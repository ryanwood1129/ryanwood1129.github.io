    <h1> <strong> About Me! </strong> </h1>
<p> My name is Ryan Wood. I am from Wilton, Connecticut, which is about a two hour drive to Kingston Campus. I am a freshman enrolled at the <a href="https://www.uri.edu/">University of Rhode Island </a>. Last semester, I took CSC 101 and I am currently taking CSC 106. I am hoping to majorin computer science as it is something I really enjoy doing. </p>
    
<p> One thing that I really enjoy is watching and playing sports. I grew up playing basketball, soccer, and lacrosse. However, I only carried lacrosse and basketball into high school. I am a big fan of the <a href="https://www.clevelandbrowns.com/">Cleveland Browns</a>, as that is where my father grew up. Every year we go out to a game in Cleveland, so I have sadly grown to like them, as they are horrible. </p>
