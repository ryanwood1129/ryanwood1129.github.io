    <h1> <strong> <center>About Me! </center></strong> </h1>
<p><center>My name is Ryan Wood. I am from Wilton, Connecticut, which is about a two hour drive to Kingston Campus. I am a<br> freshman enrolled at the <a href="https://www.uri.edu/">University of Rhode Island </a>. Last semester, I took CSC 101 and I am currently taking CSC 106.<br> I am hoping to majorin computer science as it is something I really enjoy doing. </center></p>
    
<p><center> One thing that I really enjoy is watching and playing sports. I grew up playing basketball, soccer, and lacrosse. However, I<br> only carried lacrosse and basketball into high school. I am a big fan of the <a href="https://www.clevelandbrowns.com/">Cleveland Browns</a>, as that is where my<br> father grew up. Every year we go out to a game in Cleveland, so I have sadly grown to like them, as they are horrible. My <br>favorite food has to be pizza, and my favorite pizza restaurant is Colony Grill which is located in Norwalk, Connecticut.</center></p>
