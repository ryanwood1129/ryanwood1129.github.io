    <h1> <strong><center> Welcome to Ryan's Final Project Page!  </center></strong> </h1>
<p><center> For my final project that I made in CSC 106, I decided to make a game. This game that I made is a maze. The way it work is that you click the start button, and navigate your way through the entire first maze without hitting into any of the red pillars. Hitting those pillars will cause a restart. Once you make it through that first maze, you click the next button, and then it will bring you to the second maze. After completing the second maze without hitting any obstacles, click the next button one more time. This will display your final screen, congratulating you on finishing the maze.</center></p>
<p><center> I decided to add the video of my code explanation so my viewers can understand what went into making the code. However, just to simplify it, I will write some of the explanation here. First off I made four seperate scenes; a title, maze 1, maze2, and the congratulatory message. I used a khan button class to activate the buttons you see, which will bring you to the new scenes. I also put in for loops that have the parameters of the bars, so if you hit them, the message "click restart" appears on your screen. I hope you enjoy!!"</center></p>
